# Git Hooks Quick Reference

## What Are These Hooks?

Automated reminders that display before/after commits to help coding agents follow the project workflow.

## Key Points

✅ **Non-blocking** - Never prevents commits  
✅ **Non-interactive** - No input required  
✅ **Just reminders** - Agents verify the checklist themselves

## When Do They Trigger?

**Pre-commit:** When committing code files (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, `.json`)  
**Commit-msg:** On every commit  
**Post-commit:** After successful commit

## What Do They Check?

### Before Commit (pre-commit):
- [ ] Task created/updated in `tasks.json`
- [ ] Task status is current
- [ ] Feature status updated in `features.json` (if applicable)
- [ ] Context documented in `ui/ui-context/` or `agents/agents-context/`
- [ ] Code is tested and clean
- [ ] JSON files are valid syntax

### After Commit (post-commit):
- Reminder to mark tasks as completed
- Reminder to update feature status

## For Coding Agents

When you see the checklist, simply **verify** you've done these steps. The commit will proceed regardless.

## Bypassing Hooks

If needed:
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

## Reinstalling Hooks

```bash
./setup-git-hooks.sh
```
